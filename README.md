## 🎧 Audio Quality Notice

This player features a fully manual **128-band logarithmic equalizer** plus **1 master gain controller**, without automatic DSP enhancements or compression. This results in cleaner, brighter, and more textured sound—capturing even subtle harmonic details often lost in mainstream players.
